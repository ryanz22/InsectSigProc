# Speech separation with LibriMix

This folder contains some popular recipes for the [LibriMix Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11262.pdf) (2/3 sources).

* This recipe supports train with several source separation models on LibriMix, including [Sepformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154), [DPRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06379), [ConvTasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454), [DPTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13975).

## How to setup

Additional dependencies:
```
pip install mir_eval
pip install pyloudnorm
```

## How to run
To run it:

```shell
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix
```

Run on 3090/4090

```shell
PYTHONPATH=. nohup python3 \
pytorchstudy/insect_snd_sep/train_insect.py \
config/insect_snd_sep/hparams/insect-mix2-gh-gh-clean.yaml \
--data_folder datasets/pestdataprocess/sound/insect_sep_ds/train-ds/mix2-gh-gh-clean/ &> mix2-gh-gh-clean_nohup.txt &
```

Run on A100-80GB

```shell
PYTHONPATH=. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 nohup python3 \
pytorchstudy/insect_snd_sep/train_insect.py \
config/insect_snd_sep/hparams/insect-mix2-gh-gh-clean.yaml \
--data_folder datasets/pestdataprocess/sound/insect_sep_ds/train-ds/mix2-gh-gh-clean/ &> mix2-gh-gh-clean_nohup.txt &
```

How to run multiple GPU:

  "To use data_parallel backend, start your script with:\n\t"
                "python experiment.py hyperparams.yaml "
                "--data_parallel_backend=True"
                "To use DDP backend, start your script with:\n\t"
                "python -m torch.distributed.lunch [args]\n"
                "experiment.py hyperparams.yaml --distributed_launch=True "
                "--distributed_backend=nccl"


Note that during training we print the negative SI-SNR (as we treat this value as the loss).

### Inference

```shell
PYTHONPATH=. python app/snd_sep.py inference --test-sample data/test/mix3-gh-cricket-bird-clean/mix_0.wav --model-dir models/mix3-gh-cricket-bird-clean-k8s4/ --out-dir data/test/mix3-gh-cricket-bird-clean/ --n-src 3

PYTHONPATH=. python app/snd_sep.py inference --test-sample ext-data/test/mix2-gh-cricket-aug-clean/mix_4.wav --model-dir ext-models/convtasnet/mix2-gh-cricket-aug-clean-k16s8/ --out-dir ext-data/test/mix2-gh-cricket-aug-clean/cnvtasnet/k16s8/ --n-src 2
```

### Results

Here are the SI - SNRi results (in dB) on the test set of LibriMix dataset with SepFormer:

| | SepFormer. Libri2Mix |
| --- | --- |
|SpeedAugment | 20.1|
|DynamicMixing | 20.4|


| | SepFormer. Libri3Mix |
| --- | --- |
|SpeedAugment | 18.4|
|DynamicMixing | 19.0|


### Example calls for running the training scripts

* Libri2Mix with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True`

* Libri3Mix with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True`

* Libri2Mix with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True --use_wham_noise True`

* Libri3Mix with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True --use_wham_noise True`


The output folder with the trained model and the logs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DN49LtAs6cq1X0jZ8tRMlh2Pj6AecClz?usp=sharing) for 3-speaker mixtures and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NPTXw4i9Vmahhr5BSQQa-ZTTm45FwYJA?usp=sharing) for 2-speakers ones.

### Multi-GPU training

You can run the following command to train the model using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) with 2 GPUs:

```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --distributed_launch --distributed_backend='nccl'

PYTHONPATH=. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3 nohup python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 pytorchstudy/insect_snd_sep/train_insect.py config/insect_snd_sep/hparams/insect-mix2-gh-gh-aug-clean-k8s4.yaml --data_folder data/sound/insect_sep_ds/train-ds/mix2-gh-gh-aug-clean/ --distributed_launch --distributed_backend='nccl' &> mix2-gh-gh-clean-k8s4.out &
```
You can add the other runtime options as appropriate. For more complete information on multi-GPU usage, take a look at this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13pBUacPiotw1IvyffvGZ-HrtBr9T6l15?usp=sharing).

## Datasets

### Libri2/3 Mix
* The Dataset can be created using the scripts at `https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix`.


### Dynamic Mixing:

* This recipe supports dynamic mixing where the training data is dynamically created in order to obtain new utterance combinations during training.
